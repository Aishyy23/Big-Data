# Yet Another Map Reduce (YaMR)
# Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to implement the main core components of Map Reduce Frmework. Three operations are 
performed in this project:
* WRITE - Given an input file, split the file into multiple partitions and store it across multiple worker nodes.
* READ - Given a file name, read partitions from the workers and display them to the user
* MAP REDUCE - Given an input file, mapper and reducer file executes MapReduce Job on the cluster.

# Procedure to use:
1. Git clone the URL
2. Install File split : pip install file split
3. To run the framework, go to master file and run the master.py file.
4. To run the Operations go the client file and run the client.py file.
